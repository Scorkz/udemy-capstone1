        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            With over 10 years of working in IT support roles I have gained invaluable skills diagnosing and troubleshooting issues 
            on various platforms and software packages. I’m used to managing my own workload and juggling numerous projects whilst 
            resolving a variety of help desk tickets at a time. My experience has allowed me to evolve along with the industry so 
            that I am able to implement the best solutions, keep up with new products and offer the highest possible level of customer 
            support.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have seven years of experience working in the video games industry; an industry that I’m hugely passionate about and 
            eager to continue progressing my career within.
